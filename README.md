# oscutil
A utility for sending, receiving, recording, and playing back OSC messages.

The actual code of the utility is written in Python, but for simplicity in distribution,
it's wrapped in an executable and a few auxilary files, so everything is in one directory
(dist) and you don't need to install Python.
